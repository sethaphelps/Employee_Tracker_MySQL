# SQL Employee Tracker

## Description

For this assignment I needed to create a CLI application that helps keep track of employees. The functionalities of the application are listed below. 

- View departments, roles, and employees
- Add a department
- Add a role
- Add a new employee
- Update an employee's role

The user will run the command 'npm start' in the command line to begin. They then will be prompted to choose which action from above they would like to execute. Watch the walkthrough video to see its full functionality.
